Creation of Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv

General installs:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To connect the chat bot in the future we will need to download models to 
our local machines and run them locally but for now you can sign up on 
the openai website to get a free trial (and free requests to their api)

Once you've signed up go to the api key page, create an api key then create
a file with the name ".env" in the base directory and put in that file this:

OPENAI_API_KEY="the api key you generated on openai's website"



Substitute your api key in the quotes.

IMPORTANT: NEVER and i mean NEVER push an api key to github
there are bots scraping public git repos for accidents like this
and they will steal that api key and use it as much as possible

You should then be all good to run the debug configuration and test the server
yourself
